## tl;dr

Just a guy reviewing media from the 80s/90s/early 00s.

## Introduction

Hello internet, though this isn't the first time I've made this statement-- in the format of a blog--, I'm happy to be *meeting* you.

So, my name is Kyle. I live in Seattle. I like movies, and tv, and books... you get the point. 

It seems that a lot of the movies I enjoy or find intriguing were released before I was really aware of them or able to consume them. 
That being said, I still want to talk about these things, and what better way then by talking to everyone at the same time?

## What happens now?

Well, nothing really. My first review will, most likely, be on Dazed and Confused. Current Working sub-title "Everything cool happens in cars.".
