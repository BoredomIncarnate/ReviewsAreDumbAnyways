## Dazed and Confused
#### High school was crazy & everything cool happens in cars

"Dazed and Confused" _(Richard Linklater, 1993)_ was a sort of shibbolith for coolness when I was growing up; the kind of movie that, if mentioned around the _cooler_ elder youth, would-- generally-- get a good reaction. This created a sort of Pavlovian response for me. So, whenever someone brought up the movie, even though I had never seen it, I would mention something about how it is good. 

Fastforward to the summer of 2020, I'm watching an older Joe Rogan podcast and he is interviewing Kevin Smith. I'm a big fan of Kevin Smith's earlier works. "Clerks", "Chasing Amy", and "Mallrats" are still some of my favorite movies. So, I'm watching this podcast and Joe Rogan asks Kevin Smith about getting into movies. Then Mr. Smith brings up how "Slacker" inspired him to make movies. Something about that made me go "I should watch 'Dazed and Confused'." They are by the same director and "Dazed and Confused" is much more widely known; it seemed like as good of a start as any.

As you can see, the data suggests "Dazed and Confused" is pretty good, if not great. And from the anecdotal evidence I gathered _(asking friends and family what they thought)_. No one I talked to said it was amazing, but some-- including my Dad-- seemed to have remenised fondly about it. And that is really all the research I did on this movie before watching it.
