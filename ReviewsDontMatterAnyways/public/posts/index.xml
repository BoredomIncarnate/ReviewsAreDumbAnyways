      <description>tl;dr Just a guy reviewing media from the 80s/90s/early 00s.
Introduction Hello internet, though this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve made this statement&amp;ndash; in the format of a blog&amp;ndash;, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be meeting you.
So, my name is Kyle. I live in Seattle. I like movies, and tv, and books&amp;hellip; you get the point.
It seems that a lot of the movies I enjoy or find intriguing were released before I was really aware of them or able to consume them.</description>
